 finishing Launch, and trying to finish tube.c and trying to make the makefile work properly and neatly according to the instructions of the lab.

  Worked the whole day on tube.c, I added and removed so many things from it. First off I added and removed neccassry and unnecassery libraries. Then behind the scene I added all the comparisions each for arg and child pid 1 and 2 that has to go through, and then fill in that skeleton-like with read and write, close and open, and duplications. I also added the memory allocation part from launch.c into tube.c to behave the same but tube does a lot more by adding each command to its own address, then when retriveing them it turns into string and it copies/compares based on that situation for each command. Also removed unused variables.

    For some reason define wasn't added so if I were to have turned that in, it would've sucked alot.
