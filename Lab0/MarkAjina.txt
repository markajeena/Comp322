1.Added Libraries and made Decimal Conversions. Also created a read.

2.Changed variables to fit parameters on the conversion method

3.Changed read completely, and my print started printing vertically as I 
wanted it too, but print out still needed to be fixed at that point.

4.Parity added to the code with some minor changes

5.Thought I was finished but corrected some syntax errors in the 
github lab0.c

In the parameters of the conversion I was using integer then changed to 
Char* and converted string to Int and then did a decimal conversion, 
I also worked on the read file part in the main and print method to fit the 
changes of done to the parameters.
