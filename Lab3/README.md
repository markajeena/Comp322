  Started on the code, added includes and variables that will be used throughout the code. Had some minor changes the same day.

  pt1: Fixed global variables to 0, and added signals in SIG array.
  
  pt2: Added the sigHandle method, then after realizing I was missing a lot of components.
  
  pt3: fixed the sigHandle method and was still trying to figure out what should happen if each statement were to be invoked. Added a new sigCatch method w/ just a few variables inside.
  
  pt4: added statements in catcher that whenever invoked they'd print what signal was caught and at what second they were caught at.
  
  pt5:Finished up handler statements.
