04/21/2020 - the beginning 

04/28/2020 

added a skeletal makefile, and attempted at the code a little bit

04/29/2020

added print message to both eat and think message

04/30/2020

Added many things I feel like im 85% done with just have to fix errors. I added signal handler and dining methods. Dining does many things, it has two statements that if they get inflicted they do specific things to position and seats, and if the other is invoked it works with cycles then completes the philosophers dinner.
