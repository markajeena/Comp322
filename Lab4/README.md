04/21/2020 - the beginning 

04/28/2020 

added a skeletal makefile, and attempted at the code a little bit

04/29/2020

added print message to both eat and think message

04/30/2020

Added many things I feel like im 85% done with just have to fix errors. I added signal handler and dining methods. Dining does many things, it has two statements that if they get inflicted they do specific things to position and seats, and if the other is invoked it works with cycles then completes the philosophers dinner.

solved errors with dining method, completed the philosophers dinner, still fixing signal Handler, if i cant figure it out I will work on the script of launch-philosopher.


(8:30pm)

good news solved Signal handler issues, bad news closing semaphores became a problem which gave dining method minor problems. Should finish soon. Hopefully. 

05/02/2020 Pulling an all-nighter better be worth it
