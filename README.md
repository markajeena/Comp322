# Lab0Comp322

This is my lab0 for comp322                 
Status: Complete                      

Recent Updates: Fix in paramter pointers and added a print line, fixed also my binary to decimal conversion.
at the moment: working on how to print it out properly and also checking all numbers to see if they work and print as they should.

Work:
(Start)Feb. 01, 2020
Start a respitory. Creation of Lab0.c

Feb. 02, 2020 
1.Added Libraries and made Decimal Conversions. Also created a read.

2.Changed variables to fit parameters on the conversion method

3.Changed read completely, and my print started printing vertically as I 
wanted it too, but print out still needed to be fixed at that point.

4.Parity added to the code with some minor changes

5.Thought I was finished but corrected some syntax errors in the 
github lab0.c

Feb. 04, 2020
In the parameters of the conversion I was using integer then changed to 
Char* and converted string to Int and then did a decimal conversion, 
I also worked on the read file part in the main and print method to fit the 
changes of done to the parameters. 

--(at this point I've made a new folder where I put my Lab0)

Feb. 07, 2020
1.Made final changes to the print out line, now the code works perfectly.

(End)Feb. 08, 2020
Added makefile and my test file of text.
